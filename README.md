Description: Here is a long descrption to test how it will look on the Code Exchange page. This is pulled from the readme denoted by a "Description:" and terminated by either the end of the paragraph or by Tags followed by : like description. Depending on the length of the description it may need to be limited on the code exchange page. This is currently stored on the object in Salesforce and can change the character limit. This will be an easy way to set the length on the page. Trim the last three characters and inser elipses instead denoting that there is more text for the description. I feel like the lenght of this description should be sufficent to determine if there needs to be a set length.
